# Learning Resources

**Archived**: *This repository has been archived. I've realized that maintaining it mainly indulges [my tendency to collect](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/) rather than genuinely aiding my learning process. I'd prefer to invest this time in actual learning instead.*

A list of learning resources that I would like to refer back later or intent to study.
