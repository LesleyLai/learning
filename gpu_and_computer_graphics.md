## Ray Tracing
- [ ] ðŸ“„ ["Monte Carlo Methods for Light Transport Simulation"](https://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/veach_thesis/) - the Academy Award-winning PhD thesis by Eric Veach. It starts from *bidirectional light transport algorithms* and introduces *multiple importance sampling* and *Metropolis light transport*
